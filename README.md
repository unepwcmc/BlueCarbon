# BlueCarbon
EcoPlotter application to analyse the data collected about blue carbon in the Abu Dhabi coastline

## Development Setup
You'll need to install the postgis extensions in the database before it will migrate, if your setup is like mine, you can do this by adding the postgis template to the database.yml:

    template: template_postgis

## Deployment

The app is now deployed on Brightbox....and can be deployed in the normal way.
