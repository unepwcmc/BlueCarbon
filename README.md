# BlueCarbon

# THIS REPOSITORY IS RETIRED

Blue Carbon has been rewritten as [Blue Forest](https://github.com/unepwcmc/BlueForest). Although they serve slightly different purposes, Blue Carbon should be considered as replaced by Blue Forest as the Blue Forest code is considerably improved and refactored. This repository should only be used in maintaining the current Blue Carbon website capabilities.
