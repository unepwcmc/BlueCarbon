      <h3>BLUE CARBON DEMONSTRATION PROJECT</h3>
      <p>In just over 40 years, Abu Dhabi has evolved from a small fishing community to the largest and most populated of the seven Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With the vision and direction from His Highness the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the environment has become an intrinsic part of the heritage and traditions of the people of the UAE.</p>
       <p>This national affinity to the sea has led to the initiation of the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon Demonstration Project in order to explore the values which coastal ecosystems provide the UAE, and to help preserve our environmental and cultural heritage.</p>

      <h3>PROJECT TEAM</h3>
      <p>The Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon Demonstration Project is facilitated by AGEDI and supported by the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD), and an expert team led by GRID-Arendal, including UNEP, UNEP-WCMC, Forest Trends, and a group of world-class coastal carbon scientists.</p>

      <h3>BLUE CARBON ASSESSMENT TOOL</h3>
      <p>The tool can be used to broadly assess the impact of development on coastal marine habitats and the associated blue carbon stock, helping to make informed decisions relating to the future development of Abu Dhabi. For more information on using the tool, visit the help page.</p>

      <h3>ABOUT THE DATA</h3>
      <p><img src="/assets/pages/out_on_sea.png" alt="Out on sea" id="img-out-on-sea">Baseline layers representing marine habitats (mangrove, salt marsh, seagrass and algal mats) around coastal Abu Dhabi were provided by the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency. They have been developed through a combination of comprehensive field based sampling, supported by Landsat and RapidEye satellite imagery analysis. Habitat layers have been enhanced further through input received from stakeholder consultation during the Abu Dhabi Local, National and Regional Biodiversity Assessment undertaken in 2011-13.</p>
      <p>The habitat layers are continually updated to reflect the ongoing dynamics of Abu Dhabi&#39;s coastal habitats. </p>

    <h4>Calculating the carbon stocks within an AOI</h4>
    <p>Carbon stocks are based on the above- and below ground carbon stored within each habitat type, estimated from field-based measurements.</p>
    <p>Further habitat parameters such as density, age and status (natural or planted) further help to improve the accuracy of these estimates. The quality of these estimates will further improve with time, as more accurate datasets become available.</p>
    <p>Please note that although the outputs derived from the Blue Carbon Assessment tool are based on the best possible scientific information currently available, there will inevitably be margins of error within the outputs. These are due to the fact that assumptions are made for much of the area, based a limited amount of data collected in the field. Any information derived from the tool should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
    <p>The carbon stock outputs provided include:</p>
    <p><span class="light-blue">Total Carbon Stock:</span> Provides an estimate of the tonnes of carbon within the Area(s) of Interest of all blue carbon habitats combined.</p>
    <p>Total Area: Denotes the total area covered within the Area(s) of Interest in square kilometres.</p>
    <p><span class="light-blue">The Equivalent Per Capita CO2 Emissions:</span> Provides an estimate of the average CO2 output of a UAE citizen. This can be expressed either in the number of days or years, depending on the size of the output. The CO2 output used here is 20.87 tons, as estimated for 2011 by the European Commission/Joint Research Centre1.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
    <p><span class="light-blue">Blue Carbon Habitats in This Area:</span> Provides a breakdown of the contribution of each habitat to i) the total area (km2), ii) the % of habitat as part of the total coverage within Abu Dhabi, iii) the carbon stock (tonnes) within the AOI.</p>

      <h3>WHAT IS BLUE CARBON?</h3>
      <p>In addition to their climate related benefits, Blue Carbon ecosystems provide highly valuable Ecosystem Services to coastal communities. They protect shorelines, support coastal tourism, and provide nursery grounds for fish and habitats for a wide range of species. They also have significant cultural and social value. The conservation and restoration of Blue Carbon ecosystems can be supported by funds generated through ‘Payment for Ecosystem Services’ schemes such as carbon offsets.</p>
      <p>The Blue Carbon concept has strengthened interest in the management and conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, supporting climate change mitigation efforts. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of Blue Carbon, and incentives are needed to ensure more sustainable environmental management practices.</p>
